\section{Introduction}

The main goal is to get control over the fingerprint of the browser.
Having that control will allow us
to study the effect of different fingerprints
on the act of fingerprinting.
The act of fingerprinting uses the fingerprint
to track a specific user
and possibly serve specific content to that user
based on the tracking data.
When we have control over the fingerprint the web server \emph{sees}
when we visit a website,
we can study if and how the content of that website changes
based on differences in the fingerprint we \emph{serve}.
