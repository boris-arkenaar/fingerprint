  abstract = {Objective
Analysis of congenital heart surgery results requires a reliable method of estimating the risk of adverse outcomes. Two major systems in current use are based on projections of risk or complexity that were predominantly subjectively derived. Our goal was to create an objective, empirically based index that can be used to identify the statistically estimated risk of in-hospital mortality by procedure and to group procedures into risk categories.
Methods
Mortality risk was estimated for 148 types of operative procedures using data from 77,294 operations entered into the European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery (EACTS) Congenital Heart Surgery Database (33,360 operations) and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Congenital Heart Surgery Database (43,934 patients) between 2002 and 2007. Procedure-specific mortality rate estimates were calculated using a Bayesian model that adjusted for small denominators. Each procedure was assigned a numeric score (the STS–EACTS Congenital Heart Surgery Mortality Score [2009]) ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 based on the estimated mortality rate. Procedures were also sorted by increasing risk and grouped into 5 categories (the STS–EACTS Congenital Heart Surgery Mortality Categories [2009]) that were chosen to be optimal with respect to minimizing within-category variation and maximizing between-category variation. Model performance was subsequently assessed in an independent validation sample (n = 27,700) and compared with 2 existing methods: Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery (RACHS-1) categories and Aristotle Basis Complexity scores.
Results
Estimated mortality rates ranged across procedure types from 0.3\% (atrial septal defect repair with patch) to 29.8\% (truncus plus interrupted aortic arch repair). The proposed STS–EACTS score and STS–EACTS categories demonstrated good discrimination for predicting mortality in the validation sample (C-index = 0.784 and 0.773, respectively). For procedures with more than 40 occurrences, the Pearson correlation coefficient between a procedure's STS–EACTS score and its actual mortality rate in the validation sample was 0.80. In the subset of procedures for which RACHS-1 and Aristotle Basic Complexity scores are defined, discrimination was highest for the STS–EACTS score (C-index = 0.787), followed by STS–EACTS categories (C-index = 0.778), RACHS-1 categories (C-index = 0.745), and Aristotle Basic Complexity scores (C-index = 0.687). When patient covariates were added to each model, the C-index improved: STS–EACTS score (C-index = 0.816), STS–EACTS categories (C-index = 0.812), RACHS-1 categories (C-index = 0.802), and Aristotle Basic Complexity scores (C-index = 0.795).
Conclusion
The proposed risk scores and categories have a high degree of discrimination for predicting mortality and represent an improvement over existing consensus-based methods. Risk models incorporating these measures may be used to compare mortality outcomes across institutions with differing case mixes.},

Since ads provide a significant portion of revenue on the web, significant effort is put into attracting users to them. Malicious agents take advantage of this skillful attraction and then redirect users to malicious sites that serve malware.
Advertisers use Web 2.0 functionality to provide flexibility and portability in sharing third-party content across different networks, websites and blogs. They use widgets, frames and Javascript banners in order to load and execute content from ad servers into user websites. But attackers can take advantage of flaws in features such as widgets and iframes to redirect browsers to malicious websites that deliver malware.
To appreciate the severity and prevalence of this class of attack, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP.org) recently placed invalidated redirects and forwards in its ‘2010 top 10’ list. Aditya Sood and Richard Enbody of Michigan State University discuss the exploitation model of malvertisements and the way different modes of attacks are used to infect users.},

Our study reveals the rampancy of malvertising: hundreds of top ranking Web sites fell victims and leading ad networks such as DoubleClick were infiltrated. To mitigate this threat, we identify prominent features from malicious advertising nodes and their related content delivery paths, and leverage them to build a new detection system called MadTracer. MadTracer automatically generates detection rules and utilizes them to inspect advertisement delivery processes and detect malvertising activities. Our evaluation shows that MadTracer was capable of capturing a large number of malvertising cases, 15 times as many as Google Safe Browsing and Microsoft Forefront did together, at a low false detection rate. It also detected new attacks, including a type of click-fraud attack that has never been reported before.},
